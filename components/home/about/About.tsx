                Hello! I&apos;m David Crimi, a passionate software developer with a strong
                foundation in computer science and expertise in backend development,
                full-stack applications, and cloud technologies. I recently completed my
                B.Sc. in Computer Science with Honors from York University and am currently
                working as a Software Analyst Intern at Hitachi Rail.

                My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages including Python,
                Java, C++, and JavaScript. I&apos;m proficient with modern frameworks such as
                React, Django, Flask, and Next.js, and have experience working with various
                databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. I&apos;m particularly
                interested in building scalable systems and implementing efficient DevOps practices.

                I&apos;ve developed several impactful projects, including Impactifyâ€”an IoT-based
                brain health monitoring system for contact sports that won first place at Hack
                the Valley among 400 participants. I also created a Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
                application using Neo4j, demonstrating advanced graph traversal algorithms, and
                an Optimal Uber Finder application that uses geospatial algorithms to save users
                an average of 30% on ride costs.

                holder, I&apos;m committed to industry best practices and continuous learning.
                At Hitachi Rail, I&apos;ve improved CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker,
                achieving a 40% reduction in build execution time while enhancing system stability
                and documentation.
