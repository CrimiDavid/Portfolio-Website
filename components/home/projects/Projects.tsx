          Developed multiple gameplay modes, the game supports both Human vs
          Human and Human vs AI modes. The AI includes a RandomAgent, which
          makes random moves, and a GreedyAgent, which evaluates and selects
          optimal moves, offering varied levels of challenge.

        <p>
          Built with JavaFX, the game features an easy-to-navigate user
          interface with clickable board cells for selecting and making moves.
          Players receive real-time feedback on valid moves and can save/load
          game states, making the gameplay experience smooth and user-friendly.

          The project follows S.O.L.I.D principles, which ensure that the
          codebase is maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend. By organizing
          the system into well-defined classes and abstractions, it promotes
          flexibility for future development while preserving the integrity of
          the existing functionality. This design approach also ensures that
          each component is modular, reducing the impact of changes and allowing
          for new features or modifications to be seamlessly integrated.
